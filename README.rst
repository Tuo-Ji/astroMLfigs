Enhanced Textbook Figures
----------------

This repository is an effort to hack upon and/or enhance the source code used to generate every figure in the book `Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy`.

The main enhancements will be aimed at:
* visualization, e.g. color, annotations
* animation, e.g. how does the plot look for a variety of parameters
* interactivity, e.g. user-editable parameters
* d3.js or bokeh integration
